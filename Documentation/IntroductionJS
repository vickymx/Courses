In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags. For example: 

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>

JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML or innerText.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.

When we want to change an HTML element we use - innerHTML. When we want to change plain text we use - InnerText.ðŸ¤“

/* Data types are divided into two groups:
Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)
byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int	Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits
boolean	Stores true or false values
char	Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values
Use float or double?
The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point.
The precision of float is only six or seven decimal digits, while double variables have a precision of about 16 digits. 
Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations. */
